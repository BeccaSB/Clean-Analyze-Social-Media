**Clean & Analyze Social Media**
Introduction

Social media has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, with platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook serving as essential communication channels. Social media data sets are vast and complex, making analysis a challenging task for businesses and researchers alike. In this project, we explore a simulated social media, specifically Tweets, data set to understand trends in likes across different categories.

**Prerequisites**

To follow along with this project, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming and data analysis concepts. Familiarity with the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries will also be helpful.

**Project Scope**

The objective of this project is to analyze tweets and gain insights into user engagement. We will explore the data set using visualization techniques to understand the distribution of likes across different categories. Finally, we will analyze the data to draw conclusions about the most popular categories and the overall engagement on the platform.
